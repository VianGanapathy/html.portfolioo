<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I’m Vian, a 3rd year BTech Computer Science student with a keen interest in web development. I enjoy exploring new technologies and creating interactive, user-friendly web applications that solve real-world problems.

When I’m not diving into code, you’ll often find me on the football field, spending quality time with my friends, or catching up on some much-needed sleep. I believe in striking a balance between work, play, and relaxation, which helps me stay focused and motivated.

I’m always looking to learn, grow, and collaborate with others on exciting projects. Feel free to connect if you share similar interests or want to work on something creative!
